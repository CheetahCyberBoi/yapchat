# YapChat
YapChat is a collection of crates for Rust that (hopefully) build up a complete and functional chat server implementation.
YapChat is in active heavy development so every commit can and should be taken as a breaking change.

## Compilation
To compile the various components of YapChat, simply `cd` into their directory and run `$ cargo build --release` for release builds or `$ cargo build` for development builds.
Look inside `target/release` or `target/debug` respectively and locate the executable.

## Pull requests and commits
As this is a personal passion project, I am not accepting pull requests outside of those from my trusted friends for now. However, if you have a feature suggestion or bugfix, I will gladly take it!
